🏠 Mumbai Rental Market Analysis & Rent Price Prediction

This repository contains the complete code and analysis for a deep dive into the Mumbai housing rental market. This project was executed from the perspective of a Data Analyst advising a real estate investment firm (like SP Property Solutions) on strategic pricing, investment, and client advisory.

🌟 Executive Summary

The analysis successfully built a Random Forest Regression Model that explains 78% of the variance in rent ($R^2=0.7798$) and has an average prediction error of $\mathbf{INR\ 20,945}$ (MAE). The key finding is that while property size is the largest determinant of rent, location, and the number of bathrooms are critical factors for achieving premium rental yields.
